## Adding Papers

- If the paper is from Arxiv, just copy paste the URL, and accept the meta data and PDF in the terminal.
- If the paper is from another source, providing a DOI, download the paper, and copy the doi url into the URL field. Pressing `add`, will prompt you with a file dialog. Choose the pdf and confirm.
- If the paper is from a source without DOI information, change to the second tab and select enter the information you would like to add. Again, clicking `add` will prompt you with a file dialog to choose the PDF file.
